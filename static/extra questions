beryl burton-Yes, Beryl's 12-hour record, set on September 17th 1967, still stands, after she cycled 277.25 miles. What is even more remarkable is that she beat the men's world record that day, overtaking all 99 men and offering men's champion Mike McNamara a Liquorice Allsort as an energy booster as she did so. It took a man another two years to better her mark.

It was Billie Jean King taking on Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match dubbed the ‘Battle of the Sexes’. Having taken up the challenge to play against the former world champion and self-proclaimed male chauvinist pig, Billie had the whole of womankind willing her on. She did not disappoint, coming away with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win. The story is currently being made into a Hollywood movie starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell.
